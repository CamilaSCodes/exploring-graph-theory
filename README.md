# Studying graph theory

## Studying graph properties with SageMath, a mathematical software system

Here, you'll find my exploration of some concepts covered in the Graph Theory course, leveraging the powerful resources of SageMath. SageMath is a versatile mathematical software renowned for its broad spectrum of features convering graphs, calculus, number theory, algebra, and beyond.

Throughout my studies, I examined:

* Weighted and unweighted graphs; 
* Connected and disconnected graphs; 
* Directed and undirected graphs.
  
In the process, I gained insights into their fundamental properties, including:

* Identification of cycles;
* Analysis of edge and vertex counts;
* Understanding of isomorphism;
* Exploration of subgraphs;
* Determination of shortest paths utilizing different algorithms, such as Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford.

Studying graphs has been an enriching experience that has deepened my understanding of complex mathematical structures and their practical applications. Understanding the intricacies of graphs and their properties is crucial for tackling a myriad of real-world problems, from designing efficient algorithms to modeling complex networks.
